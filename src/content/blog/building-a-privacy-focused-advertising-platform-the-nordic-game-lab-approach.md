### **1. Privacy by Design**
Nordic Game Lab prioritized privacy from the outset. Here's how they achieved it:

- **Minimal Data Collection**: Unlike traditional ad platforms, Nordic Game Lab minimized data collection. They only gather essential information for ad targeting, avoiding invasive practices.
- **Anonymization**: User data is anonymized before processing. Personal identifiers are stripped, ensuring privacy.
- **Consent-Driven**: Users explicitly consent to data usage. Transparent opt-in mechanisms empower users to control their information.

### **2. Contextual Targeting**
Nordic Game Lab's platform leverages contextual targeting:

- **Content Analysis**: Instead of tracking individual users, they analyze content context. Ads are matched to relevant content, preserving privacy.
- **Keyword-Based**: Keywords within content drive ad placement. For example, an article about racing games might display ads for gaming peripherals.

### **3. Differential Privacy**
To prevent re-identification, Nordic Game Lab uses differential privacy:

- **Noise Injection**: Noise is added to aggregated data. This statistical noise prevents pinpointing individual users.
- **Privacy Budget**: A budget limits how much information can be extracted from the data. Once exhausted, no further insights are gained.

### **Conclusion**
Nordic Game Lab's privacy-friendly advertising platform demonstrates that profitability and privacy need not be at odds. By embracing privacy-enhancing technologies and respecting user consent, they've created a win-win scenario for advertisers and users alike.
